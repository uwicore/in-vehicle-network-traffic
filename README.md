# in-vehicle-network-traffic
This repository includes in-vehicle network data traffic generated using a Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM) platform that seamlessly combines CARLA’s realistic 3D driving environment with the autonomous driving capabilities of the Autoware AD software stack.

## Acknowledgment of Tools
The dataset was generated using the following open-source software:
- **CARLA Simulator** – [MIT License] (https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/0.9.15/LICENSE)
- **Autoware AD Stack** – [Apache License 2.0] (https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/blob/2024.01/LICENSE)

These tools were used solely to generate synthetic data. The dataset itself does not contain code from CARLA or Autoware, but we gratefully acknowledge their role in enabling this work.
